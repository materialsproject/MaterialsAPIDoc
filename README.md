## Introduction

This is the public repo for the documentation of the Materials API. The 
Materials API is a simple, flexible and efficient interface to programmatically
query and interact with the [Materials Project](https://www.materialsproject.org)
database based on the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) pattern for the
web. Since its creation in Aug 2012, the Materials API has been the Materials
Project’s de facto platform for data access, supporting not only the Materials
Project’s many collaborative efforts but also enabling new applications and
analyses.

## Example notebooks

We have added a few example ipython notebooks demonstrating the features of 
the  Materials API. The NB Viewer version is at this
[link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/materialsproject/mapidoc/tree/master/example_notebooks/). Also, you can use the [Binder](http://mybinder.org/) service (in beta) to launch an interactive notebook right now! Click the button below to open our introductory notebook. To nagivate to other notebooks, go to "File->Open" within the page and click `example_notebooks` to open one of them.

## Using this repo

The usage of this repo follows a REST format. The primary use of this repo is
to  explore the Materials Project's document format and use that info for much 
more powerful queries with the [pymatgen](http://www.pymatgen.org) (Python 
Materials Genomics) MPRester.query() method. For more standard queries, the 
Materials API already has a [wiki page](https://materialsproject.org/wiki/index.php/The_Materials_API)
and pymatgen already provides useful high-level functions for them.

1. Start from the [materials](https://github.com/materialsproject/mapidoc/tree/master/materials)
   directory in this repo. The nested directory structure follows the
   MongoDB json-like document schema for the Materials Project's *materials*
   collection.
2. In each folder, there is a README.md that describes what that key is. For
   example, in materials/final_energy, the README.md informs you that the 
   *final_energy* key refers final calculated energy of the material.
   Similarly, the materials/task_id informs you that the *task_id* key is in 
   fact the materials id for the Materials Project.
3. To use this in MPRester, one may use the following code:

    ```python
    from pymatgen import MPRester
    m = MPRester()
    data = m.query(criteria={"task_id": "mp-1234"}, properties=["final_energy"])
    print(data)
    ```

   The data obtained is then `[{u'final_energy': -26.94736193}]`. Note that the
   data returned is always a list of dicts.
4. For a more complicated example, you can try:

    ```python
    data = m.query(criteria={"pretty_formula": "Li2O"}, properties=["spacegroup.symbol"])
    ```

   You can identify the appropriate key by going to the 
   materials/spacegroup/symbol subfolder. This means that the desired
   information is in spacegroup.symbol (concantenate all subfolders with "."
   and drop the initial "materials" prefix).
5. One more very complicated example. Let's say you would like to query for the
   tags and icsd_ids of all materials containing Fe and O, and perhaps other
   elements.

    ```python
    data = m.query(criteria={"elements": {"$all": ["Fe", "O"]}}, properties=["exp.tags", "icsd_ids"])
    ```
   
   Note that the criteria and properties follows the format (and richness) of
   MongoDB queries. You can refer to the
   [MongoDB documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/) for more
   information on how to customize queries.

It should be noted that not all materials documents contains all keys, e.g.,
some properties may not have been computed for certain materials yet. If you
request for a key that is not present in a doc, the query will return None. For
the most part, the documents are relatively consistent, especially for many of
the common keys like elements, formulas, etc.

## Alternative usage of this documentation

While the easiest way to use the Materials API is to leverage pymatgen's
high-level interface to it, you may also directly submit a http
POST query to `https://www.materialsproject.org/rest/v2/query`. For
instance, you may wish to write your own app or queries in another language.

The `https://www.materialsproject.org/rest/v2/query` API provides
functionality for flexible queries against the Materials Project database using [MongoDB syntax](http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.6/reference/operator/query/), enabling queries which would otherwise not
be possible using the other simpler REST forms. For example, a POST to query
with parameters

```javascript
criteria = '{"elements":{"$in":["Li", "Na", "K"], "$all": ["O"]}, "nelements":2}'
properties ='["formula", "formation_energy_per_atom"]'
```

will return the formula and formation energy per atom of all Li, Na and K
oxides.

Using the command-line tool [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/):
```bash
curl -s --header "X-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>" \
    https://materialsproject.org/rest/v2/query \
    -F criteria='{"elements": {"$in": ["Li", "Na", "K"], "$all": ["O"]}, "nelements": 2}' \
    -F properties='["formula", "formation_energy_per_atom"]'
```

Using Python and the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install) library:
```python
import json
import requests

data = {
    'criteria': {
        'elements': {'$in': ['Li', 'Na', 'K'], '$all': ['O']},
        'nelements': 2,
    },
    'properties': [
        'formula',
        'formation_energy_per_atom',
    ]
}
r = requests.post('https://materialsproject.org/rest/v2/query',
                 headers={'X-API-KEY': '<YOUR-API-KEY>'},
                 data={k: json.dumps(v) for k,v in data.items()})
response_content = r.json() # a dict
```

Using another language, e.g. MATLAB? See [this MP discussion forum thread](https://discuss.materialsproject.org/t/http400-when-making-post-query-via-matlab/2431) for more guidance. In particular, you need to treat "criteria" and "properties" as fields whose data are JSON-serialized strings.

### Tips for efficient querying

Try to minimize the scope of the properties you are requesting. For example,
if you are only interested in the XRD pattern for Cu K<sub>&#945;</sub>,
do not just use `properties=["xrd"]` which will fetch the computed XRD
patterns for all wavelengths. This results in a larger data transfer and slow
queries. Instead, use `properties=["xrd.Cu"]`.

## Searching for properties

You can use Github's built-in search box at the top to search this repository
for text that matches your query. For example, you can try searching for the
word "spacegroup" to see the that the "spacegroup" root key exists with
sub-keys such as "number" and "symbol". 

Beause this repository's folder structure mirrors a material document's
structure, you can also use the
[quick finder](https://github.com/materialsproject/mapidoc/find/master)
(keyboard shortcut: <kbd>t</kbd>) to interactively explore the structure.
